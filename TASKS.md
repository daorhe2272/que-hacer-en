# Project Tasks

This file outlines the development tasks for the "QuÃ© hacer en..." project. We will track our progress here by checking off items as we complete them. This list will be continuously updated as the project evolves.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority Focus

**Phase 2: Web App Frontend (MVP)** has been successfully completed! The frontend design is now fully implemented with custom background images, sticky navigation, system fonts, and comprehensive UI/UX matching the prototype specifications.

**Phase 3: Backend API Development** is our immediate priority. With the frontend complete, we need to build the backend infrastructure to support real data and user interactions.
