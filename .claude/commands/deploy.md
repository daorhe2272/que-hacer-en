We are going to push our changes to origin master, but first we need to make sure we do these things first:
1) Check all api unit tests pass
2) Check there are no linting errors for api and web
3) Check the builds work for api and web
4) Add all changes to git (git add .)
5) Commit with an appropriate brief message
6) Push to origin master
