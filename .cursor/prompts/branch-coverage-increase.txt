Our objective is to increase our api unit tests Branch coverage. No other metric matters. First, identify which files have the most potential for improvements in Branch coverage. Take note of which lines of code need coverage. The idea is to increase Branch coverage incrementally. Add tests one by one, targeting the specific uncovered branches. Feel free to cover several lines in a single test if it makes sense. You can measure your success based on whether the targeted line is covered by the test or not and whether Branch coverage increased in general. If a test does not improve Branch coverage, that is a useless test. Perform a thorough analysis on why is the test not behaving as desired and determine if the desired Branch can actually be targeted or not. Don't add other tests until the previous test increased coverage. If it's not possible to cover a branch, ask for permission from the user to remove the test and proceed to target a different branch. If you detect problems or shortcomings in the source code during test implementation, report them to the user immediately.
